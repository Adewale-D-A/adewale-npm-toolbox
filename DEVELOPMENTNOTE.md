##### To test locally before deployment

> use `npm link` on the package you want to test
> use it in your project with `require('adewale-utils-toolbox')` in the project where you want to use it for server projects and run `npm link adewale-utils-toolbox` in the project where you want to use it by importing `import { jsonToCSVuriConverter } from "adewale-utils-toolbox"` for UI usecases. This installs the dependency locally for you to test with
